This is where I document and store my Python coding exercises
<br> as part of my language learning journey.

<br> In this repository, you'll find a collection of Python exercises and projects
<br> that I've worked on to improve my coding skills. 
<br>
<br> The ideas for the respective tasks originate from the courses I have attended,
<br> the internet, books, or they occurred to me spontaneously.  

**Feel free to explore the exercises and projects!**  

*If you have any suggestions or improvements, please let me know.*

**Setup**  
*Before I can start, some decisions have to be made!*  
<br>

**Language selection**  
- [X] **Python** (for this repository)
  
<br>
  
**Programming tool**  
*The choice of the right IDE is not only influenced by the programming language and professional requirements  
but is also a matter of personal preference.*  
  
Currently, I have decided to use VSC (Visual Studio Code).  
Although VSC is more of a text editor than a full-fledged IDE,  
it allows me to work with multiple languages without being restricted to just one.   
This enables me to focus more specifically on learning concepts and syntax,  
as I only need to familiarize myself with a program and its functionalities once.  
  
<br>
  
**Enviroment**  
*I know that I actually have to think about how to separate my private data and developer data from each other  
and also how to create an environment for each language in which it has what it needs and only what it needs.*  
I have to skip that topic for now because WSL, NixOS-Shell, Conda, etc. is a huge topic
  
<br>
  
**Filemanagement**  
*In addition to logic and syntax, the management of individual files is essential.*  
 
- [X] Version control  
- [X] Online access  
- [X] Easy setup on any device  
 
What better choice is there than the combination of Git & GitHub?  
Even knowing that there are cons other options and, I am opting for this combination initially.
